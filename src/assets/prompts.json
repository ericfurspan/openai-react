  "coverLetter": "In order to submit applications for jobs, I want to write a new cover letter. Please compose a cover letter describing my technical skills. I've been working with web technology for 8 years. I've worked as a frontend developer with React for 5 years. I've grown by employing some tools. These include HTML, CSS, JavaScript/TypeScript, React, Nodejs, AWS, and so on. I wish to join a passionate team of strong engineers to yet further develop my full-stack development skills. Can you write a cover letter for a job application about myself?"
